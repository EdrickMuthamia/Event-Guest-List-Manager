# Event Guest List Manager

## Description

This is a simple Event Guest List Manager application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to dynamically add guests to a list, remove them, manage their RSVP status, and categorize them. The application is designed to practice DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript without page reloads.

## Features

*   **Add Guests**: Enter a guest's name and add them to the list.
*   **Remove Guests**: Each guest has a "Remove" button.
*   **Guest Limit**: The guest list is limited to a maximum of 10 guests.
*   **Toggle RSVP Status**: Mark guests as "Attending" or "Not Attending." The guest's name color changes to reflect their status (green for Attending, red for Not Attending).
*   **Guest Categories**: Assign a category (Friend, Family, Colleague) to each guest, displayed with a colored tag.
*   **Timestamp**: The time each guest was added is displayed next to their name.
*   **Edit Guest Name**: An "Edit" button allows modification of a guest's name.
